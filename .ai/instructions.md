# AI Prompt: Convert Repository into a Grant Configuration Repository

Use the current repository as the target repository and compare it with:

https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-config-bootstrap

## Working Rules

* Clone or fetch the latest version of the bootstrap repository for comparison.
* Preserve existing repository functionality unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* When merging content:

    * Retain existing target-repository content.
    * Add bootstrap content where missing.
    * Avoid duplicate entries.
    * If a conflict exists, prefer bootstrap implementation unless repository-specific behaviour would be lost.
* Maintain the existing formatting and code style.
* Run validation steps after each major change where applicable.
* Record all modifications in git.

---

## 1. Create Working Branch

1. Checkout `main`
2. Pull the latest changes
3. Create a new feature branch named:

   feat/bootstrap-grant-configuration

---

## 2. Documentation Updates

### README

1. Compare:

    * `README.md`
    * `bootstrap/docs/README.md`

2. Merge content into the target `README.md` using the following rules:

    * Keep existing section links.
    * Add a new section link named **Grant Configuration**.
    * Add four child section links to **Grant Configuration**, named: **Create new**, **Update existing**, **Non-configuration changes** and **Hotfix release**.
    * Place **Grant Configuration** as the first section link.
    * Insert the Grant Configuration content immediately after the section links.
    * Preserve all existing repository-specific documentation.
    * Replace Dependabot and SonarCloud badges with bootstrap versions.

## 3. Package Configuration

### Dev Dependencies

Uninstall (will install the latest version shortly):

```bash
npm uninstall -D vitest @vitest/coverage-v8
```

Install:

```bash
npm install -D vitest @vitest/coverage-v8 @changesets/cli @changesets/changelog-github
```

### Runtime Dependency

Install:

```

Rules:

* Keep all existing scripts.
* Replace `$TARGET_REPO_NAME$` with the repository `name` field value.

* Do not remove repository-specific configuration.

---

## 4. Changesets

1. Initialise Changesets:

```bash
npx changeset init
```

2. Create an initial changeset by writing a markdown file into .changeset/ rather than running the interactive npx changeset command. Use the repository package name and set the release type to minor with the summary "Add grant configuration support to the repository"

3. Copy:

```text
bootstrap/changeset/pr-changeset-check.yml
```

to:

```text
.github/workflows/pr-changeset-check.yml
```

Rules:

* The changeset file created must follow naming conventions. Example: initial-boot-strap.md
